        <p style="font-size: 13px">
          My most defining characteristic is probably my perfectionism. Although this has proven to be both a strength and a weakness,
          I have learnt to leverage it into being the former.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 13px">
          I started programming at the age of 7, using Visual Basic, after one of my dad&#39;s colleagues had left some textbooks at
          our house. In my early teens I started doing freelancing work, mainly in web development, until I landed a part-time
          position at a game development studio (<a href="http://brightmindstudios.com/" target="_blank">BrightMind Studios</a>)
          based in Cape Town. I led a team of 3 as we worked on a series of brain-training puzzle games. My next position
          was quite a leap from the last. I was employed as lead designer for a 3D shooter game by a studio (<a href="http://bonozo.com/"
            target="_blank">Bonozo</a>) based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I was in charge of making critical decisions and leading
          a team (40 - 50 people) of artists, developers, musicians and testers. After a few more years of freelancing I
          joined a South African media agency (<a href="http://madepod.com/" target="_blank">MadePod</a>) as head of development
          and equal shareholder. Our portfolio included Carte Blanche, Sage, Jacaranda FM and Netcare.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 13px">
          I eventually left to further my studies and focus on my own company. I am currently finishing a degree in computer science
          and working as a research assistant at both the System Specifications and Formal Methods (SSFM) research group
          and the Computational Intelligence Research Group (CIRG). I am a firm believer in being a life-long learner and
          am continually striving to improve myself. I value the opinion of others and think it can be observed in my daily
          actions that I aim to make the world a better place. I also like to think I have a good sense of humour. My skillset
          includes various programming languages (Though a new one is easily learnt), leadership, project management, technical
          expertise and practical engineering skills.

          <p style="font-size: 13px">
            I have a prior honors degree from the University of Pretoria in Information Design. This has given me a deep understanding
            of design principles, such as human computer interaction, basic philosophy and some psychology with regards to
            media and social interaction. I also have technical skills involving design implementation, ranging from Photoshop
            to basic 3D applications such as Blender modeling, to post-processing work in After Effects for animation. I
            worked for three years as a designer and animator at one of South Africa’s top production companies, Monarchy
            Productions, and thus I am no stranger to following clients’ brief and working towards mutual satisfying products
            that are to the best of my ability.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 13px">
            I am currently studying a BSc in IT to further my horizons and my interests, as I have a love for creative problem solving
            and find that both Information Design and Computer Science satisfy this. I strive to merge the two more closely
            though, once I start working again. I am particularly interested in A.I. but mainly in regards to its role of
            emergent narrative in gameplay, for I have always been interested in computer games and their study and development
            and I have a passion for all games ranging from board games to card games to role-playing games to video games,
            and it would not be an understatement to say that a lot of my career decisions and interests of study is affected
            by this.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 13px">
            I tend to be a more people and emotionally driven person than most other computer scientists, i.e. more feeling than thinking,
            and as such I enjoy working as a team and aiding in communication wherever possible, getting a kick out of others
            doing really well. I also hate giving up or admitting defeat to something I know I can overcome and as such I
            tend to be very driven and hard working.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 13px">
            My interests include: Computers, games of all kinds and their study (i.e. Ludology), illustration, painting, #D modeling
            and sculpting, Design, A.I., Robotics, Puzzles and Problem Solving, Human-Computer Interaction.

        <p style="font-size: 13px">
          I am currently completing the final year of my degree (BSc Computer Science). From a young age, I developed an interest in
          computers and as a result decided to pick Information Technology (IT) as one of my subjects in Grade 9. The interest
          was only further cultivated due to which I ended picking Computer Science as my field of choice.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 13px">
          Apart from the main-stream CS modules I have taken three elective modules - Compiler Construction, Artificial Intelligence
          and Computer Grpahics. I enjoy working mostly on back-end programming (i.e. more algorithmic in nature).
        </p>


        <p style="font-size: 13px">
          My academic record has been consistently of a good standard so far. I am generally a hard-worker by nature and am excited
          by the prospeccts of 301 Capstone Project. I look forward to work with the prospecctive client and user in delivering
          a successful final product.

            I am third-year Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. I have been interacting with computers as long as
            I can remember, and they have become an integral part of my life. I enjoy being challenged, and find the greatest
            satisfaction learnnig something new. I am continually inspired by the great Computer Science minds of modern
            history, and my colleagues around me.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 13px">
            In my second year, I worked as a technical assistant for the Computer Science Department, which entailed managing servers
            and developing the University&#39;s Computer Science website. I have also taken part in a number of programming
            competitions, namely the Standard Bank IT Challenge and the ACM Collegiate Programming Competition.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 13px">
            I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science, number theory and theories of computation. I am passionate about open-source
            software, and creating software that is not only conceptually engaging, but practically useful.

          <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 1px;">
            I am a full time computer geek and can&#39;t get enough of technology. I developed a interest in programming when a friend
            convinced me to take IT at school. I quickly found that I had an aptitude for programming an my love for solving
            problems with software grew from there. I always challenge my self to find new and innovative ways to solve problems
            I encounter.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 1px;">
            Some of my skills include:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Java Application Development</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Computer Graphics</li>
            <li>Networking</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 1px;">
            I have worked on a few web development projects like <a href="http://www.fabervervoer.co.za" target="_blank">Faber Vervoer&#39;s website</a>            and <a href="http://www.electech.co.za" target="_blank">ElecTech</a>.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 1px;">
            I also enjoy tinkering with my Raspberry Pi and building IoT projects with it. I have built a email to SMS API, a diy Steam
            Link and a few other smaller projects with the Raspberry Pi.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 1px;">
            When I am not in front of a computer screen I enjoy outdoor activities like running, mountain biking and swimming.
